“ML project to predict loan default using classification”

This project predicts whether a loan applicant is likely to default using machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Decision Tree).

##  Steps:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Label Encoding
- Model Training: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

##  Libraries Used:
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

##  How to Run:
